# Hospital Management System

## Project Idea :

A simple project idea where we can apply the mentioned concepts in DBMS is a Hospital Management System.

This system will include features such as managing the Patient’s details, Doctor’s details, patient’s records, and last but not least Appointment details. For this project, we can utilize SQL as the database language. Applying concepts like normalization, DDL commands, advanced SQL queries, and database security, we can develop a functional system that keeps a record of the patient’s details, and manage their records, and Doctor’s statuses.
